# MentalHealthApp

This App got developed by a team of three in the Experimental Game Design module of a BA Game Design course.

## The concept

Due to a lack of well developed and actually helpful tools to reintroduce a simple routine in ones life, 
we wanted to make a simple but motivating app for exactly that purpose.  
Through gentle encouragement and a personalised reward-system the user is steered in the direction of a more organised life.  
This app can also be used as blueprint for organisatory tools that are not mental health related.

## Have a look!

This repository contains the entire Unity project, NOT the build.  
To play, run the Unity Editor and play inside it.
